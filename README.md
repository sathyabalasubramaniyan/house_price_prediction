PREDICTING PRICE OF HOUSES BY ANALYSING VARIOUS FACTORS
     
 #The project applies regression algorithmn on dataset to predict the selling price of a new home.
  #The objective of the project is to perform data visulalization techniques to understand the insight of the data
  #This project evaluate the performance and the predictive power of a model trained and tested on data set 
   
# METHOD 1:
# MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSION
   Linear Regression refers to a model that assumes a linear relationship between input variables and target variables.Linear regression attempts to model the relationship between two variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data.
   Multiple Linear Regression is an extension of Simple Linear Regression.Multiple regression generally explains the relationship between multiple independent or predictor variables and one dependent or criterion variable.
# METHOD 2:
# RIDGE REGRESSION 
  With increase of no of features,regression equation becomes higher order(polynomial equation)and leads to overfit that mean doesn't fit for realtime values and eliminate overfit by reducing size of coefficients 
  Ridge Regression is a popular type of regularized linear regression that includes an L2 penalty and  an extension of linear regression that adds a regularization penalty to the loss function during training.L2 penalty is to penalize a model based on the sum of the squared coefficient values (alpha). 
# METHOD 3:
# LASSO REGRESSION 
 Lasso Regression uses L1 regularization technique and also  extension of linear regression that adds a regularization penalty to the loss function during training.L1 penalty is to penalize a model based on the absolute of the squared coefficient values (alpha).
 # METHOD 4:
# ELASTIC NET REGRESSION 
  By combining lasso and ridge regression we get Elastic-Net Regression. Elastic Net is proved to better it combines the regularization of both lasso and Ridge
# METHOD 2
# GRADIENTBOOSTING REGRESSION
   Gradient boosting is one of the most powerful techniques for building predictive models and It is a machine learning technique for regression and classification problems, which produces a prediction model in the form of an ensemble of weak prediction models, typically decision trees.
 
   
we have predicted the house price using different ML model algorithms.
Gradient boosting regression was found to be the better model for predicting house prices. It performed the regession algorithms with performance accuracy of 95%
